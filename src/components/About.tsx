                My passion for software engineering began during my studies at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, 
                where I achieved a 97.3/100 GPA while participating in an exchange program at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
                This international experience broadened my perspective on global tech practices and collaborative development.

                At C3.ai, I've had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI applications, improving data pipelines 
                and developing prototype companion apps that reduced system regressions by 25%. My experience at HP 
                further strengthened my skills in data analysis and internal tooling.

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond technical skills, I'm passionate about mentoring others and contributing to diversity in tech 
                through my involvement with Women For The Future and various teaching initiatives. I believe the best 
                software is built by diverse teams who understand their users deeply.
